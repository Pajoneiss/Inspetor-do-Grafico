## The Biology of Peak Performance

> *"Sound body, sound trade."*

Trading is a **high-performance cognitive activity**. A chess player burns as many calories in a tournament as a marathon runner.
Your brain is your hardware. If hardware is bad (tired, inflamed, distracted), software (strategy) will run with bugs.

## 1. Sleep: System Reset
During REM sleep, brain processes daily info and regulates emotion.
*   **Problem:** Sleep-deprived traders have a 60% more reactive amygdala (fear/anger center). Result: Impulsive, fearful, angry trading.
*   **Rule:** 7-8 hours quality sleep. Dark room, no screens 1h before bed. Never trade tired.

## 2. Dopamine Detox
The market is addictive. Flashing lights, PnL moves... it's a casino for the brain.
Excess stimuli (Social Media, 1-min charts) fry dopamine receptors. You lose patience. Patience is Trader Virtue #1.
*   **Challenge:** 1 hour/day screen-free. Read a book. Walk. Re-sensitize your brain to waiting hours for a setup.

## 3. Nutrition for the Brain
*   **Sugar & Insulin Spikes:** Sugar gives fast energy, then a mental crash (brain fog). You make stupid mistakes in brain fog.
*   **Eat:** Proteins, healthy fats (avocado, nuts), water. Stable blood sugar = stable emotions.
*   **Caffeine:** In moderation. Too much coffee spikes cortisol (stress) and anxiety. Anxious traders over-click.

## 4. Exercise: Stress Antidote
Trading generates cortisol. Accumulated cortisol kills neurons and causes disease.
The only way to "burn" this is intense physical activity.
A trader who trains operates calmly.

## Lifestyle Summary
No point having the best bot if you operate hungover, sleepless, or stressed.
Treat trading like pro sports. Olympians don't eat fast food before finals.
