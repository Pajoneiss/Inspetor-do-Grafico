# Chapter 09: Crypto Tech & Future of Money
## Engineering, Consensus, and Freedom

> *"Code is Law."*

We covered history (Satoshi). Now let's open the hood. How does this magic work and why is it hackable if you are careless?

## 1. The Blockchain Trilemma
Vitalik Buterin posited a chain can only have 2 of 3:
1.  **Decentralization** (No boss).
2.  **Security** (Un-hackable).
3.  **Scalability** (Fast/Cheap).

*   **Bitcoin:** Decen + Secure. (Slow/Expensive).
*   **Solana:** Scalable + Secure. (More Centralized).
*   **Solution:** Layers.

## 2. Layer Architecture

### Layer 1 (Foundation)
Main chain (BTC, ETH).
*   Function: Final settlement security.
*   Cost: High. Like parking in Manhattan.

### Layer 0 (Interconnection)
Connecting chains (Polkadot, Cosmos). Internet of Blockchains.

### Layer 2 (Speed)
Networks on top of L1. Process 1000 txs off-chain, settle result on L1.
*   **Rollups (Arbitrum):** ETH security, cheap fees.
*   **Lightning Network:** BTC L2 for instant payments.

## 3. Consensus Mechanisms

### Proof of Work (PoW) - Brute Force
*   Bitcoin.
*   Requires Energy + Hardware.
*   *Pro:* Physical energy anchors digital value. Unforgeable cost.
*   *Con:* Energy intensive.

### Proof of Stake (PoS) - The Bet
*   Ethereum.
*   Requires Locked Capital (Staking).
*   *Pro:* Green (99% less energy).
*   *Con:* "Rich get richer" (Plutocratic centralization risk).

## 4. Tokenomics
How to spot scams?
1.  **Supply:** Infinite (Doge) vs Finite (BTC).
2.  **Vesting:** Are team tokens locked? If unlocked -> Rug Pull risk.
3.  **Utility:** Does token do anything (Governance/Gas)?

## 5. Advanced Cybersec

### Smart Contract Hacks
Hackers find code bugs.
*   **Reentrancy:** Hacker drains balance before balance updates.
*   **Flash Loan:** Borrow $1B, manipulate price, profit, repay in 15 seconds.

### How to Protect
1.  **Revoke Cash:** Remove old permissions.
2.  **Air Gap:** Use old offline laptop to sign txs.
3.  **Multisig:** Wallet requiring 2/3 keys to move funds.

## Summary
Tech is neutral. It can liberate (Bitcoin) or enslave (CBDCs).
Technical knowledge is your defense.
The **Inspector** trades the surface (Price), but relies on this deep infrastructure running 24/7.
