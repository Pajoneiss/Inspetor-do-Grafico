# Chapter 11: The Almanac of Greed
## The History of Crashes, Legends, and Blood

> *"History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes."* — Mark Twain

The financial market is a graveyard of egos. To survive, you must study the bodies.
Let's travel back in time and see how human greed always ends the same way: **Bubble and Collapse.**

## 1. The Museum of Horrors (Great Crashes)

### The Tulip Bubble (Holland, 1637)
*   **The Mania:** People traded houses for a single rare tulip bulb.
*   **The End:** Someone asked: *"It's just a flower, right?"*. Price fell 99% in days.
*   **Lesson:** **Intrinsic Value**. Price can detach from reality, but gravity always wins.

### The 1929 Crash (Great Depression)
*   **The Mania:** "Stocks never fall". Waiters and shoeshine boys traded 10x leveraged.
*   **The End:** Black Thursday. Market fell 89% over 3 years. Suicides.
*   **Lesson:** **Leverage kills.** When everyone is optimistic, the end is near (Shoeshine Boy Indicator).

### The Dot-com Bubble (2000)
*   **The Mania:** Any company with ".com" was worth billions despite zero profit.
*   **The End:** Nasdaq fell 78%. Amazon dropped 90% (and lived). Pets.com vanished.
*   **Lesson:** Tech revolution does not justify infinite Valuation.

### The Global Financial Crisis (2008)
*   **The Mania:** Banks lent to people who couldn't pay to buy houses. Packaged this trash (MBS) and sold as Gold (AAA).
*   **The End:** Lehman Brothers collapsed. World system froze. Bitcoin was born here (Ch. 9).
*   **Lesson:** **Systemic Risk**. Never blindly trust institutions.

### Crypto Winters (2013, 2017, 2022)
*   Bitcoin dropped 80%+ multiple times.
*   2022 saw "Geniuses" (SBF/FTX) go to jail.
*   **Lesson:** Cycles are law. Who buys euphoria tops waits 3 years in red.

## 2. Pantheon of Gods (and Demons)

### Jesse Livermore: The Greatest Trader Ever
*   **Feat:** Started at 14. Broke 4 times. Made $100 Million (Billions today) in 1929 Crash shorting everything.
*   **Tragedy:** No emotional control outside market. Depression. Suicide.
*   **Lesson:** Making money is easy; **keeping it** is hard. Market doesn't solve personal problems.

### Warren Buffett: The Oracle
*   **Feat:** Buys good companies, *never sells*. Got rich slowly.
*   **Lesson:** **Compound Interest**. Time > IQ.

### Paul Tudor Jones: The Macro Master
*   **Feat:** Predicted 1987 crash. Tripled capital while world burned.
*   **Technique:** Technicals to time Fundamental ideas.
*   **Lesson:** *"Losers average losers"*. He cuts losses fast and aggressively. Zero ego.

### George Soros: The Man Who Broke the Bank of England
*   **Feat:** Bet $10 Billion against British Pound. Made $1 Billion in a day.
*   **Theory:** **Reflexivity**. Price affects fundamentals, fundamentals affect price. Feedback loop.

## 3. Opera Summary
All geniuses shared one thing: **Respect for Risk.**
Those who lost it (Livermore at end, SBF) were destroyed.
The market is a wild beast. You can ride it, but never tame it.
Use the **Inspector** as your seatbelt.
