# Chapter 10: Fundamental Analysis & Macroeconomics
## The Game of Financial Thrones

> *"Don't fight the Fed."* — Martin Zweig

You can be the best technical analyst in the world. If the Federal Reserve decides to drain the world's liquidity, your chart will fail.
Technical Analysis says **WHEN** to buy.
Fundamental Analysis says **WHAT** and **IF** you should buy.

## 1. The World Engine: Liquidity and Rates
The market doesn't rise because "companies are improving". It rises because there is **excess cash** looking for yield.

### The Faucet (Interest Rates)
*   **Low Rates (Open Faucet):** Money is cheap. Companies borrow to grow. People spend. Stocks/Crypto (Risk) rise.
*   **High Rates (Closed Faucet):** Money is expensive. "Risk Free" (US Treasuries) pays 5% a year. Why risk on Bitcoin? Capital flees risk for safety. Market falls.

### Inflation (The Silent Thief)
When govt prints too much money, value drops. Prices rise.
To fight inflation, Central Bank raises Rates (to cool economy). An eternal cycle of **Expansion and Contraction**.

**The Economic Cycle:**
1.  **Recovery:** Rates drop. GDP grows. Buy Stocks/Crypto.
2.  **Expansion:** Euphoria. Everything up. Inflation appears.
3.  **Slowdown:** Central Bank hikes rates. Sell Risk. Buy Dollar.
4.  **Recession:** Crisis. Unemployment. Golden Opportunity to buy real assets cheap.

## 2. Forex and Commodities: Canaries in the Mine
Before Bitcoin moves, the real world moves.

*   **DXY (Dollar Index):** Dollar strength vs world.
    *   *Rule:* If DXY moons, Crypto/Stocks dumps. Dollar is the black hole sucking liquidity.
*   **Gold (XAU):** Fear hedge. Rise = Fear of war/bank collapse.
*   **Oil (WTI):** World energy. Expensive Oil = Inflation = High Rates = Stocks Down.

## 3. Economic Indicators (The Calendar)
Don't trade blind. Check **ForexFactory**.
*   **CPI (Consumer Price Index):** Measures inflation. Most important data today.
*   **Payroll (NFP):** US Jobs. Too strong jobs = Inflation = High Rates = Drop.
*   **FOMC (The Fed Meeting):** When Jerome Powell speaks, the world stops. Insane volatility. Do not trade during the speech.

## 4. Crypto Fundamentals (Tokenomics)
How to analyze if a coin has real value or is trash?

1.  **Market Cap vs FDV:**
    *   *Market Cap:* Current total value.
    *   *FDV (Fully Diluted Value):* Total value if all coins were unlocked.
    *   *Trap:* Low Cap ($10M) but Huge FDV ($1B). Means huge sell pressure (inflation) coming via unlocks.
2.  **TVL (Total Value Locked):** Real money locked in DeFi protocol. TVL up = Good.
3.  **Revenue:** Does it generate fees? Or just prints tokens for fake yield?
4.  **Community/Devs:** Active GitHub? Public team?

## Summary
The **Inspector** looks at Price. You must look at Context.
If Fed prints -> Inspector finds Buys.
If Fed burns -> Inspector finds Shorts.
Swim with the macro current.
