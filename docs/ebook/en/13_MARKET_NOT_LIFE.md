# Chapter 13: The Market Is Not Your Life
## Trading is a Means, Not an Identity

> *"Beware the hobby that eats your life."*

You've come far. Learned technique, risk, and psychology. Sit on the AI's shoulders.
Now you need to hear the most important lesson: **Close the chart.**

### The Danger of Identification
Some traders wake up thinking about the market. Sleep thinking about the market.
At Sunday lunch with family, they're looking at TradingView.
This is illness, not dedication.

When you **identify** as a "trader", your self-esteem rises and falls with P&L.
*   **Green Day:** You're a genius. You deserve a new car.
*   **Red Day:** You're a failure. You're worthless.

This emotional rollercoaster will destroy you. The market will exploit this weakness.

### Money is a Tool
Money is not the goal. **Time** is the goal.
Well-applied money buys free time to:
*   Be with family.
*   Take care of health.
*   Read, travel, create.

If you make money but lose health, family, and peace of mind, you are a slave in luxury.

### The Healthy Routine
*   Set trading hours. Outside them, **disconnect**.
*   Use the **Inspector** so it watches your position while you live.
*   Have hobbies that don't involve screens.
*   Exercise. Your body is your first asset.

The trader who lasts 30 years is the one who lives 30 years. The one addicted to charts has a heart attack at 45.
Be smart. Be human first.
