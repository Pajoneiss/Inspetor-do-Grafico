# This Book Is NOT For You If...
## The Entry Filter

Before we continue, we must ensure we are on the same page.
This material is dense, technical, and requires maturity. It is designed to repel tourists and attract professionals.

**Close this book and ask for a refund immediately if:**

1.  **You seek quick money:** If you need to pay a bill next month with trading, you will lose what little you have. The market is not an ATM.
2.  **You cannot accept losing:** If the idea of losing money on a trade causes you physical pain, you are not ready. Losing is an operating cost.
3.  **You want excitement:** If you seek adrenaline, go skydiving. Professional trading is boring and repetitive.
4.  **You are a "System Hopper":** If you change strategy after every stop loss, no technique in this book will save you.
5.  **You seek certainty:** If you want someone to say "Bitcoin will go up tomorrow", you want a prophet, not an analyst. We work with probabilities, never certainties.

If you identified with any point above, stop.
If you understand that this is an elite profession requiring years of dedication, turn the page.
