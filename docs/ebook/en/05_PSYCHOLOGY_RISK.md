## 1. Chemical Addiction: Dopamine & Trading
Why does losing hurt but addict?
Trading activates same brain areas as Cocaine and Slots.
*   **Intermittent Variable Reward:** You don't win always. You win "sometimes". This generates max dopamine spikes.
*   **The Danger:** If you trade for emotion (boredom), you are a functional junkie, not a trader.
*   **The Cure:** Boredom. Pro trading must be BORING. If you are having fun, you are paying for entertainment.

## 2. Income Reality: The 1% Daily Myth
Influencers promise 1% a day.
*   **The Math:** $1,000 at 1% daily = **$77 Million** in 5 years. In 10 years, more than Earth's GDP.
*   **Conclusion:** Impossible to sustain 1% daily compounded long term.
*   **Real Goal:** Top Funds make 30-60% **PER YEAR**. If you make 5% a month consistent, you are a god.

### Luck vs Skill
Short term (1 day) = 90% Luck.
Long term (1000 trades) = Luck cancels out (50/50). Result is Skill minus Costs.

## 3. Survival Guide (Code of Honor)

### Dos (Commandments)
1.  **Protect Capital First:** Before winning, think about not losing.
2.  **Have a Plan:** Written. Before opening screen.
3.  **Accept the Stop:** Stop Loss is cost of business.
4.  **Journal:** Record everything.

### Don'ts (Deadly Sins)
1.  **Averaging Down:** Buying more while it drops to "fix price". Graveyard stuff.
2.  **Revenge:** "Market took $100, I will get it back". You will lose $200.
3.  **Overtrading:** Trading out of boredom.
4.  **System Hopping:** Master one thing, don't dabble in all.
5.  **Scared Money:** Never trade rent money. Scared money loses.

## 4. Path to Mastery
No shortcuts.
Study, pain, study, loss, study, breakeven, victory.
**The Inspector** shortens the pain by automating technique. But mental discipline is 100% you.
Be the adult in the room. Win the long game.
