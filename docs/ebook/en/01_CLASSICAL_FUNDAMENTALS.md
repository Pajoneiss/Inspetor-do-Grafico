# Chapter 01: Classical Fundamentals
## The Foundation of Every Professional Trader

> *"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."* — George Santayana

To build a skyscraper (your wealth), you need deep foundations. In trading, these foundations were written over 100 years ago by three giants: **Charles Dow**, **Ralph Nelson Elliott**, and **Richard Wyckoff**.

**The Graph Inspector** knows these theories intimately. Now, you will too.

## 1. Dow Theory
Created by Charles Dow (founder of the Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones index) in the late 19th century.

### The 6 Immutable Laws:

#### 1. The Market Discounts Everything
All known information, fears, news, balance sheets, and expectations are already "priced in" the chart. Don't try to outsmart the market by reading old news. **The chart is the final truth.**

#### 2. The Market Has Three Trends
Like the sea, the market has movements of different scales:
*   **The Tide (Primary Trend):** Lasts years. The secular Bull or Bear Market.
*   **The Waves (Secondary Trend):** Lasts weeks or months. Corrections against the main trend.
*   **The Ripples (Tertiary Trend):** Lasts days or hours. Daily "noise".
*   *Bot Tip:* The Inspector focuses on aligning Tertiary with Secondary for high-probability Swing trades.

#### 3. Primary Trend Has Three Phases
*   **Accumulation:** "Smart money" buys slowly while the world panics. Price stops falling but doesn't rise much.
*   **Public Participation (Markup):** Price starts rising. Retail notices, news improves. The longest and most profitable phase.
*   **Distribution:** Price soars and hits headlines. "Smart money" sells to euphoric retail.

#### 4. Indices Must Confirm
If industrial goods transport drops, industry production should drop soon after. In Crypto, if Bitcoin (master index) drops and loses lows, Altcoins are unlikely to rise healthily. We seek confluence.

#### 5. Volume Must Confirm Trend
*   Healthy Uptrend = Volume increases on rise, decreases on pullback.
*   If price rises but volume dries up (**Divergence**), it's a sign of weakness and possible reversal.

#### 6. Trend Continues Until Proven Otherwise
Don't try to guess the top. An uptrend remains valid until it makes a clear **Lower Low**. Until then, any drop is a buying opportunity.

## 2. Elliott Waves
Ralph Nelson Elliott discovered that the market moves in repetitive cycles based on mass psychology.

### The Basic Cycle (5-3)
A complete cycle has 8 waves:
*   **Impulsive Phase (5 Waves):** Moves with the main trend.
    *   **Wave 1:** The timid start.
    *   **Wave 2:** Correction (deep, but doesn't lose Wave 1 low).
    *   **Wave 3:** The biggest and strongest. Volume explodes.
    *   **Wave 4:** A complex, sideways pause.
    *   **Wave 5:** The final euphoric gasp. Often shows RSI divergence.
*   **Corrective Phase (3 Waves - ABC):**
    *   **Wave A:** The first drop.
    *   **Wave B:** The "bull trap".
    *   **Wave C:** The final painful drop, clearing stops.

### Fractality
Each wave subdivides into smaller waves.
*   *Bot Application:* The Inspector uses **Fibonacci** to measure how far Waves 2 and 4 can go. Wave 2 usually retraces 61.8% of Wave 1.

## 3. The Wyckoff Method
Richard Wyckoff focused on the **Logic of Manipulation**. He saw the market as a battle between the "Composite Man" (Market/Institutions) and the public.

### The Wyckoff Market Cycle
The market breathes in four phases:

#### 1. Accumulation (Bottom)
"Big Players" fill their bags without letting price rise. They absorb all selling supply from desperate retail.
*   **Signs:** Price ranges sideways. Volume increases at bottoms, but price doesn't drop.
*   **Spring:** A final "trap". Price falsely breaks support to stop out longs and grab final liquidity before shooting up. *The best buying point in the world.*

#### 2. Markup (Uptrend)
Supply is gone. Price explodes up. Big players are already long. Retail enters late chasing price.

#### 3. Distribution (Top)
"Big Players" sell their positions to euphoric retail.
*   **Signs:** Sideways range at top. High volume, but price doesn't rise (effort without result).
*   **UTAD (Upthrust After Distribution):** The opposite of Spring. False breakout at top.

#### 4. Markdown (Downtrend)
Demand dries up. Price crashes.

### Wyckoff Laws
1.  **Supply & Demand:** If Demand > Supply = Price Rises.
2.  **Cause & Effect:** A large Accumulation (Cause) generates a large Uptrend (Effect).
3.  **Effort vs. Result:** High volume (effort) with small candle movement (result) signals reversal.

### Chapter Summary
*   **Dow** gave us the Map (Trends).
*   **Elliott** gave us the GPS (Where we are in the cycle).
*   **Wyckoff** gave us the X-Ray (What big players are doing).

**The Graph Inspector** synthesizes this. It seeks **Wyckoff Accumulations**, measures targets with **Elliott/Fibonacci**, and enters only in favor of **Dow Trends** confirmed by SMC.
