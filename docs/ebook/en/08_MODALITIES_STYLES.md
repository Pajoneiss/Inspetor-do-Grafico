Where you store money to beat inflation.
*   **Treasury Bonds (US):** You lend to Gov. Almost zero risk.
*   **CDs:** Lend to Banks. Insured up to a limit.
*   **The Benchmark:** If you take risk in Stocks and earn less than Bonds, you are failing.

### Level 2: Classic Variable Income (Solid Attack)
*   **Stocks:** Own pieces of companies. Dividends + Growth.
    *   *Blue Chips:* Safe giants (Apple).
    *   *Small Caps:* Risky, explosive potential.
*   **REITs (Real Estate):** Own buildings. Monthly rent. Low volatility.
*   **ETFs:** Baskets of assets. **IVV** follows S&P500. Smartest passive investing.

### Level 3: Crypto & Alts (Wild Frontier)
*   **Bitcoin:** Digital Gold. Decentralized Store of Value.
*   **Altcoins:** Tech startups. 100x or Zero.
