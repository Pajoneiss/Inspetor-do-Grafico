*   **Goal:** Catch tiny moves with heavy hand (high leverage).
*   **Charts:** 1 minute (M1) or 5 minutes (M5).
*   **Profile:** High adrenaline, fast reflexes, total screen focus. Can't blink.
*   **Advantage:** Sleeps liquid (no overnight risk).
*   **Risk:** High fees and extreme mental stress.

### The Day Trader (The Match Player)

### The Swing Trader (The Strategic Hunter) -> **Inspector's Specialty**
*   **Trade Time:** Days to Weeks.
*   **Goal:** Catch the full "Leg" of a trend (Elliott Wave 3).

## 2. Asset Types: Where to Play?

### Stocks
*   **What:** Piece of real companies (Apple, Tesla).
*   **Dynamic:** Follows quarterly earnings and real economy. Slower and less volatile than crypto.
*   **Hours:** Commercial (Market closes).

### Options (Derivatives)
*   **What:** The right to buy/sell in the future.
*   **Dynamic:** Complex. Involves "Greeks" (time, volatility). Can be used for Protection (Hedge) or pure speculation. Risk of total premium loss.

### REITs (Real Estate)
*   **What:** Owning buildings/malls and getting rent.
*   **Dynamic:** Passive monthly income. Low volatility. Perfect for Conservative/Retirement profile.

### Cryptocurrencies (The Wild West)
*   **What:** Decentralized digital assets 24/7.
*   **Dynamic:** Extreme volatility (up 100% one day, down 50% the next). Inefficient market (full of arbitrage opportunities).
*   **Bot Advantage:** Since market never closes, *humans get tired*. Robots don't. Crypto is bot paradise.

## 3. Special Strategies

### Hedge (Protection)
You have $10k in Bitcoin "Hold". Market starts crashing.
Instead of selling your BTC (and paying taxes), you open a **Short** (Future Sell) of $10k on the Inspector.
*   If BTC falls 10%: You lose on Hold, but win 10% on Short. Your Dollar balance is protected (frozen). This is Hedge.

### Operation Styles

#### Trend Following
*   "The trend is your friend". Buy breakouts. Sell breakdowns.
*   *Win Rate:* Low (40%).
*   *Profit:* Huge (When huge wins cover small losses).

#### Mean Reversion
*   "Rose too much, must fall". Sell at top of Bollinger/VWAP. Buy at bottom.
*   *Win Rate:* High (70%).
*   *Profit:* Short (only back to mean).
*   *Danger:* Trying to reverse a strong trend (getting run over by the train).
